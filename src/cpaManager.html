      <p>Tabs for C, P, and A. Each shows a list of those items.</p>
      <p>Edit/Create panel that would show the selected from the current tab (for edit).
        And would have a "create new X" button for each type to create a empty CPA.
        And would have a "Save" button to save the edit or save the new CPA.
        And would have a search bar and results panel to find an existing CPA to add.</p>
